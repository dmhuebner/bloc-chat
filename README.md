### EXPLANATION

The goal of this project was to create a simple instant messaging application with JavaScript, Angular.js, and Firebase that features three way data binding and real-time application updates without refreshing the page. It was created according to user stories provided in the Bloc Full Stack Developer curriculum.

This is a simple but effective instant messaging application that can be expanded on and customized to create more robust chat applications. This project was created to practice and demonstrate my, JavaScript, Angular.js, HTML, and CSS proficiency as well as to gain more experience implementing a real-time database with Firebase. I used the Firebase AngularFire module to create three-way data binding between the HTML, JavaScript and Firebase database. This allows the application to show new instant message updates in real time without requiring the page to be refreshed.

Open Chat has a simple, mobile responsive design and utilizes UI Bootstrapâ€™s Modal service in combination with ngCookies to require users to signup for a new account or login with an existing email/password pair before proceeding to select a chat room.
